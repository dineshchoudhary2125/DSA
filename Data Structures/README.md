# Data Structures

## Definition
Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data to enable efficient access and modification. They provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently in terms of time and space.

## **1. Linear Data Structures**
Linear data structures store elements in a sequential manner.

### **1.1. Arrays**
- Static and dynamic arrays.
- Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Traversal, Searching.

### **1.2. Linked Lists**
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List

### **1.3. Stacks**
- LIFO (Last In, First Out)
- Applications: Function call stack, expression evaluation.

### **1.4. Queues**
- FIFO (First In, First Out)
- Variants: Circular Queue, Deque, Priority Queue.

### **1.5. Strings**
- Sequence of characters.
- Operations: Concatenation, Substring search, Pattern matching.

### **1.6. Hash Tables**
- Key-value pair storage.
- Collision handling techniques: Chaining, Open Addressing.

### **1.7. Matrix**
- 2D array representation.
- Applications: Graph representations, Image processing.

## **2. Non-Linear Data Structures**
Non-linear data structures organize elements in hierarchical or interconnected ways.

### **2.1. Trees**
- **Binary Tree**
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- **AVL Tree** (Self-balancing BST)
- **Red-Black Tree**
- **Segment Tree**
- **Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)**
- **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: Used for string storage and search.

### **2.2. Heaps**
- **Min-Heap**: Minimum element at the root.
- **Max-Heap**: Maximum element at the root.
- Applications: Priority Queues, Heap Sort.

### **2.3. Graphs**
- Types: Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted.
- Representations: Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix.
- Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, Kruskal's, Prim's.

### **2.4. Disjoint Set (Union-Find)**
- Used for dynamic connectivity problems.
- Operations: Find, Union.
