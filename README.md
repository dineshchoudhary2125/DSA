# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## Definition
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental concept in computer science that involves organizing, managing, and storing data efficiently for optimal access and modification. Data structures define the way data is stored, while algorithms define the steps to manipulate data within those structures.

### Why DSA is Important
- **Efficient Problem Solving:** Helps solve problems faster and more efficiently.
- **Better Code Performance:** Reduces time and space complexity.
- **Technical Interviews:** Essential for coding interviews and competitive programming.
